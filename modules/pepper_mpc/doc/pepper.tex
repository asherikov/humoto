\section{Support area}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering{
        \pgfplotsset{
            every axis post/.style={
                scale=1,
                every x tick label/.style={font=\scriptsize}, % reduce font
                every y tick label/.style={font=\scriptsize}, % reduce font
                label style={font=\scriptsize},               % reduce font
            }
        }
        \input{Figures/support_area.tex}
    }
    \caption{Circular support area in the triangle formed by the wheels of
    Pepper. Front wheels are on the right. Dashed line passes through
    \mono{KneePitch} joint.}
    \label{fig-support-area}
\end{figure}

In accordance with Pepper's documentation, the distance between the front
wheels is $b = 310 \MT{[mm]}$, while the distance distance between the back
wheel and a line passing through the front wheels is $h = 260 \MT{[mm]}$.

Hence we can compute radius of the largest circle in the triangle formed by the
wheels using
%
\begin{equation}
    r = \frac{b\sqrt{h^2 - b^2/4} - b^2/2}{2h},
\end{equation}
%
which gives $r = 88.0496680375479 \MT{[mm]}$. The circle is shown in
\cref{fig-support-area}.

The distance between ``\mono{KneePitch}'' joint and the center of the circle is
$90 - 88.0496680375479 = 1.95033196245210 \MT{[mm]}$

In the following we are going to assume $r = 70 \MT{[mm]}$, \emph{i.e.}, the
safety margin is equal to approximately $2 \MT{[cm]}$ ($18.0496680375479
\MT{[mm]}$).

\section{Base parameters}

Parameters of the base can be determined using Pepper's model in \sn{rmt}:
%
\begin{listingtcb}{Octave}
\begin{deflisting}
ids = [ ...
FRAME_Tibia, FRAME_WheelB_link, FRAME_WheelFL_link, FRAME_WheelFR_link];

bodies_mass = [];
bodies_com  = [];
for i = 1:numel(ids)
    bodies_mass = [bodies_mass, model.DP(ids(i)).m];
    bodies_com = [bodies_com, model.DP(ids(i)).c];
end

total_mass = sum(bodies_mass);
bodies_rel_mass = bodies_mass ./ total_mass;

com_global = bodies_com * bodies_rel_mass';

com_kneepitch = com_global - model.Frame(FRAME_Tibia).p;

com_height = (0.264+0.070) + com_kneepitch(3);
\end{deflisting}
\end{listingtcb}
%
The results of the computations are:
%
\begin{align}
    m_{s}       &=  16.34234 \MT{[kg]}\\
    c_{s}^{z}   &=  0.125564931735602 \MT{[m]}
\end{align}
%
and the distance from \mono{KneePitch} joint is $0.002531976618098 \MT{[m]}$.
Hence, the distance from the center of the circular support area to the base
CoM along $x$ axis is $0.002531976618098*1000 - 1.95033196245210 =
0.581644655645900 \MT[mm]$. In the following we assume that this difference is
negligible, \emph{i.e.}, the position of the base CoM always coincides with the
center of the circular support area.

\section{Upper body parameters}

Parameters of the base can be determined using Pepper's model in \sn{rmt}:
%
\begin{listingtcb}{Octave}
\begin{deflisting}
ids = [...
FRAME_torso, FRAME_Neck, FRAME_Head, ...
FRAME_Hip, FRAME_Pelvis, ...
FRAME_LShoulder, FRAME_LBicep, FRAME_LElbow, ...
FRAME_LForeArm, FRAME_l_wrist, FRAME_l_gripper, ...
FRAME_LFinger21_link, FRAME_LFinger22_link, FRAME_LFinger23_link, ...
FRAME_LFinger11_link, FRAME_LFinger12_link, FRAME_LFinger13_link, ...
FRAME_LFinger41_link, FRAME_LFinger42_link, FRAME_LFinger43_link, ...
FRAME_LFinger31_link, FRAME_LFinger32_link, ...
FRAME_LFinger33_link, ...
FRAME_LThumb1_link, FRAME_LThumb2_link, ...
FRAME_RShoulder, FRAME_RBicep, FRAME_RElbow, ...
FRAME_RForeArm, FRAME_r_wrist, FRAME_r_gripper, ...
FRAME_RFinger41_link, FRAME_RFinger42_link, FRAME_RFinger43_link, ...
FRAME_RFinger31_link, FRAME_RFinger32_link, FRAME_RFinger33_link, ...
FRAME_RFinger21_link, FRAME_RFinger22_link, FRAME_RFinger23_link, ...
FRAME_RFinger11_link, FRAME_RFinger12_link, FRAME_RFinger13_link, ...
FRAME_RThumb1_link, FRAME_RThumb2_link];


bodies_mass = [];
bodies_com  = [];
for i = 1:numel(ids)
    bodies_mass = [bodies_mass, model.DP(ids(i)).m];
    bodies_com = [bodies_com, model.DP(ids(i)).c];
end

total_mass = sum(bodies_mass);
bodies_rel_mass = bodies_mass ./ total_mass;

com_global = bodies_com * bodies_rel_mass';

com_kneepitch = com_global - model.Frame(FRAME_Tibia).p;

com_height = (0.264+0.070) + com_kneepitch(3);
\end{deflisting}
\end{listingtcb}

The results of the computations are:
%
\begin{align}
    m_{d}       &=  12.3389 \MT{[kg]}\\
    c_{d}^{z}   &=  0.763104597149514 \MT{[m]}
\end{align}
%
and the distance from \mono{KneePitch} joint is $-4.18093905757085e-03
\MT{[m]}$. Hence, the distance from the CoM of the base is $0.002531976618098 +
4.18093905757085e-03 = 0.00671291567566885 [m]$.

\subsection{Kinematic feasibility}

The default body CoM height of $0.763104597149514 \MT{[m]}$ results in a very
small kinematic feasibility area of the CoM position. Hence, we set the height
to $0.75 \MT{[m]}$.
