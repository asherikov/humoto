\section{Computation of wheel velocities}

Motion of the base in the inverse kinematics controller is represented with
translational and angular velocities. In order to execute a motion it is
necessary to map the corresponding velocities to wheel velocities, which are
the inputs of the wheel controllers of Pepper.


We assume that the $z$ axis of the global frame is normal to the contact
surface, and there is a frame $\FRAME{s}$ fixed to the base so that its $x$ and
$y$ axes span the contact surface and its origin is the center of rotation.
Then we can represent rotation in the $x$-$y$ plane from the global frame to
the base frame with $\M[][s]{R} \in \RR^{2 \CROSS 2}$.


Let $\V{v}_{s} = (\cvbase^{\MT{xy}}, {w}_{s}^{z})$ be the three-dimensional
vector of base velocity composed of translational velocity in $x$-$y$ plane and
angular velocity about axis $z$. In the following we derive matrix $\M{T}$ such
that $\V{v}_{w} = \M{T} \V[s]{v}_{s}$, where $\V[s]{v}_{s} = (\M[][s]{R}
\cvbase^{\MT{xy}}, {w}_{s}^{z})$ and $\V{v}_{w}$ is a three-dimensional vector
composed of scalar angular velocities of the wheels.


In order to compute $\M{T}$ we need to know the following parameters
%
\begin{longtable}[l]{@{\extracolsep{0pt}}l @{\extracolsep{3pt}}l p{14cm}}
    $\V[s]{d}_i$    &   $\in \RR^{3}$           &   distance to the ground contact point of
                                                    the $i$-th wheel in the base frame
                                                    (${d}_i^z = 0$)\\
    $r_i$           &   $\in \RR$               &   radius of the $i$-th wheel\\
    $\theta_i$      &   $\in \RR$               &   angle about $z$ axis representing orientation
                                                    of the $i$-th wheel in the base frame\\
\end{longtable}
%
Also, by definition, the translational velocity $\V{v}$ at distance $\V{r}$
from the center of rotation is computed as $\V{v} = \V{w} \CROSS \V{r}$, which
corresponds to scalar relation $v = w r$ when $\V{w} \bot \V{r}$.


Translational velocity at the wheel contact point in the base frame can be
computed as
%
\begin{equation}
    \V[s]{v}_i
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \M[][s]{R} \cvbase^{\MT{xy}}\\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0\\

        0\\
        {w}_{s}^{z}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \CROSS
    \V[s]{d}_i
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \begin{matrix}
            1 & 0\\
            0 & 1\\
            0 & 0
        \end{matrix}
        &
        -
        \V[s]{d}_i
        \CROSS
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0\\
            0\\
            1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \M[][s]{R} \cvbase^{\MT{xy}}\\
        {w}_{s}^{z}
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%
We have to project $\V[s]{v}_i$ on the normal of this axis $\V[s]{n}_i$, which
is equal to the negative second column of rotation matrix computed based on
$\theta_i$. Hence, the velocity of the $i$-th wheel is
%
\begin{equation}
    {v}_i
    =
    {w}_i
    {r}_i
    =
    \T{\V[s]{n}_i}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \begin{matrix}
            1 & 0\\
            0 & 1\\
            0 & 0
        \end{matrix}
        &
        -
        \V[s]{d}_i
        \CROSS
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0\\
            0\\
            1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \V[s]{v}_{s}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \T{(\V[s]{n}_i^{xy})}
        &
        -
        \T{\V[s]{n}_i}
        \left(
            \V[s]{d}_i
            \CROSS
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0\\
                0\\
                1
            \end{bmatrix}
        \right)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \V[s]{v}_{s},
\end{equation}
%
and the $i$-th row of matrix $\M{T}$ can be deduced from equation
%
\begin{equation}
    {w}_i
    =
    \frac{1}{{r}_i}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \T{(\V[s]{n}_i^{xy})}
        &
        -
        \T{\V[s]{n}_i}
        \left(
            \V[s]{d}_i
            \CROSS
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0\\
                0\\
                1
            \end{bmatrix}
        \right)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \V[s]{v}_{s}
\end{equation}
